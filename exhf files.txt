#### EXHF RESEARCH ####

Current research on EXHF files

-Starts with EXHF.
-Most bytes are the same but location 0x17 and 0x2F are changing and are always the same.
-At 0x30, 2 byte segments increment, starting from 0x01.
-Because of the last incrementing segments.... seems little endian (cmon SE wtf?)?
