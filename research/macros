MACRO DAT FILE

0x08: Size of macro book from 0x10.

The beginning of the file is still being decoded. After a 0x10 byte header, the macro entries begin. All macro entries
are XOR encoded with 0x73.
	
Each macro entry follows this format:

-Title
-Icon
-Line List

Each section begins with a marker (T, I, L), followed by two bytes (little endian) telling the size, and then the data. 
Data seems to be always null terminated. For example: 

A title: T 06 00 Greet\0
A icon: I 08 00 000ED81\0
A line: L 0A 00 Well met!\0

Each macro entry contains 1 title, 1 icon, and 15 lines. All three of these entries must exist even if not used,
with data size being 0x01 for Titles and Lines, containing an empty string ("\0"). For icons it seems the value
is always I 08 00 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 00.

-Max line size is 0x00B5.
-99 macros must exist, regardless if used (values are empty as above).
-Icons are hex values to the icon table. They can be changed to outside of what the game allows in the built in editor.

After 99 macros, the data is padded with 0s to 0x46000. This is most likely to allow the max amount of data to be filled
for all macros, lines, and titles.
