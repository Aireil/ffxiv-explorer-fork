#### SCD FILE RESEARCH ####

Current research on SCD music/sound files. Sorry it's a mess.

Structure (based on 0c0000.win32.index):

===SEDBSSCF HEADER===
0x00 Signature         Int64; SEDBSSCF
0x08 Version           Int32; For FFXIV should be 3;
0x0C ~~Unknown~~       Short; Seems to be always 0x0400
0x0E Header Size~~     Short; Points to the address where the next header is (also size of this header). Seems to be always 0x30.
0x10 File Size         Int32; Total File size
~~~~~~~~Padding~~~~~~~~       Padded to fill 48 bytes (0x2F

===OFFSETS HEADER===
0x00 Size of Offset Table 0             Short;
0x02 Size of Sound Entry Offset Table   Short; This is also the number of sounds in this file.
0x04 Size of Offset Table 2             Short;
0x06 ~~Unknown~~                        Short; In one file: 0x0001, in another 0x270F 
0x08 Offset Table 0 Offset              Int32;
0x0C Sound Entry Offset Table Offset    Int32;
0x10 Offset to Offset Table 2           Int32; 
0x14 ~~Unknown/Null~~~                  Int32;
0x18 Offset To ???				        Int32; 
  
--Table 0: 4 * [Size of Table 1]
--Table 1: 4 * [Size of Table 2]
--Table 2: 4 * [Size of Table 3] ;Offsets to Sound Entries
--Table 3: 4 * [Size of Table 1] 

--Data 1 [Pointed from Table 3]
--Data 2 [Pointed from Table 0]
--Data 3 [Pointed from Table 1]
  
---------------MUSIC IS HERE----------------------------
  
===SOUND ENTRY HEADER=== (32 byte header)
0x00 Music File Length Int32; 
0x04 Num Channels      Int32; 0x01: Mono, 0x02: Stereo, FFXIV is usually 0x02 channels
0x08 Frequency         Int32; FFXIV is usually 44100HZ (AC440000)
0x0C Data Type         Int32; 0x0C: MS-ADPCM, 0x06: OGG. FFXIV seems to use OGG for music, MS-ADPCM for sound.
0x10 Loop Start        Int32; Not known for sure, but is what vgmstream says? ||| 703,593 (0xABC69)
0x14 Loop End          Int32; Ditto ||| 1,756,597 (0x1ACDB5)
0x18 First Frame Pos   Int32; First OggS after (possibly, not always) encrypted header.
0x1C Aux Chunk Count   Short; Number of Aux Chunks

===AUX CHUNKS===
-----MARK----
0x00 ID                Int32; ASCII MARK Id
0x04 Chunk Size        Int32; Size of this chunk, from start to end.
0x08 Mark Table        ;Chunk Size / 4 entries.

===IF MS-ADPCM===
WAVEFORMATEX           See: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd390970%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
ADPCMCOEFSET           Int32; * 7

===IF OGG SEEK TABLE HEADER=== (32 bytes)
0x00 
0x02 Encode Byte        Short; If not 0x00, XOR the header with this byte
0x04 
0x08 
0x0c 
0x10 Size of Seek Table     Int32; How many seek table entries there are.	
0x14 Vorbis Header Size Int32; Size of the Ogg Vorbis header (for decoding purpose).
0x18 
~~~~~~~~~Padding~~~~~~~~       Padded to fill 32bytes 

===SEEK TABLE=== (Size is 4 * [Num Seek Table])
0x00 Seek Entry        Int32; An offset from the Vorbis header to some Ogg page. 

===VORBIS HEADER== (Size is [Vorbis Header Size])
-A standard Ogg Vorbis header. Check the encode byte in the seek table header to see if this header is encoded. If it is,
XOR all header bytes with the encode byte.
-Many songs have a LOOPSTART and LOOPEND comment tag defining where music should begin and end after the first loop.

===DATA===
Ogg Vorbis data is here

--------------Putting MS-ADPCM into WAV--------------------
-Write "RIFF"
-Write 36 + [Size of first frame to end of file]
-Write "WAVE"
-Write "fmt "
-Write 0x10
-Write wave header
-Write "data"
-Write [Size of first frame to end of file]
-Write data from [Size of first frame to end of file]
 
--------------Ogg Vorbis format info for understanding the encrypted header-----------------

===OGG PAGE===
0x00 Signature        Int32;  Value is OggS 
0x04 Version          Byte;   Seems to be 0x00 for FFXIV
0x05 Type             Byte;   Type of header: 0x01: Continuation, 0x02: Beginning, 0x03: End
0x06 Granule Position Int64;
0x0E Serial Number    Int32;  Seems to be 0x00 for FFXIV
0x12 Sequence Number  Int32;
0x16 Checksum         Int32;
0x1E Num Page Segs    Byte;   Seems to be 0x01 for FFXIV
0x1F Segment table    Byte;   Each segment is a byte long, * 0x1E's value. However, FFXIV's music only has 1 segment it seems, thus 1 byte size.
 
===VORBIS PAGE===
0x00 Header Type      Byte;   Type of vorbis header: 0x01: ID Header, 0x03: Comment Header, 0x05: Setup Header. If has leading 0, audio header.
0x01 Signature        6Bytes; VORBIS
 
--If ID Header--
1 [vorbis_version] = read 32 bits as unsigned integer
2 [audio_channels] = read 8 bit integer as unsigned
3 [audio_sample_rate] = read 32 bits as unsigned integer
4 [bitrate_maximum] = read 32 bits as signed integer
5 [bitrate_nominal] = read 32 bits as signed integer
6 [bitrate_minimum] = read 32 bits as signed integer
7 [blocksize_0] = 2 exponent (read 4 bits as unsigned integer)
8 [blocksize_1] = 2 exponent (read 4 bits as unsigned integer)
9 [framing_flag] = read one bit

--If Comment Header---
1 [vendor length] = read an unsigned integer of 32 bits
2 [vendor string] = size of vendor length; Seems to be always “Xiph.Org libVorbis I 20040717” with a varying year.
3 [fields] = read an unsigned integer of 32 bits; FFXIV only uses the LoopStart and LoopEnd fields
