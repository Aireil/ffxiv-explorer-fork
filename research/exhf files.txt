0x018 Padding?                   ; Padded to 0x1F

===Some Table???===

0x000

-EXHF files seem to define data about the EXDF files. Specifically it seems the number of columns + sizes of these column is defined here.  

-In items.exh, the table seems to be of either 2 or 4 byte entries.
-Strings and item.exh files end with 0x100, 0x200, 0x300, 0x400, 0x500
