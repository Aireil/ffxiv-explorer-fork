### HASH DB ###

This is a simple file I built to store known hashes. The format is as follows:

0x000 Signature      4bytes; PATH or 1213481296 as a number.
0x004 Num Folders    8bytes; How many folder hashes are there... is a long.
0x00C Num FullPaths  8bytes; How many files are there, as a "full path"... is a long.

===== Folder Table === (Size of Num Folders)
0x000 Hash           4bytes;
0x000 Name                 ; Terminate to 0x00

===== File Full Path Table === (Size of Num FullPaths)
0x000 Hash           4bytes;
0x000 Path                 ; Terminate to 0x00
